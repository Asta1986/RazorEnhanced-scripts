## RazorEnhanced-scripts
Personal UO RazorEnhanced scripts I'm using on [UOAlive](https://uoalive.com). With adjustments they might work on other shards too.

#### Notes
- Pause time between spells varies depending on FC and FCR values of the caster.

- Script cwd is C:\ClassicUO\ClassicUO (Wine + ClassicUO root dir in C:\ and RE as plugin).

- <RE_Root>/Config/AutoComplete.py contains mocks of the built-in classes and methods injected at runtime.
